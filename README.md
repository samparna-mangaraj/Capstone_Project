# Capstone_Project

This project is a console-based File Explorer Application developed in C++ that mimics Linux- style commands. It allows users to perform basic file operations such as creating, deleting, moving, and copying files or directories. Additionally, it supports permission management (chmod, sudo, etc.) and color-coded output to enhance user experience.
